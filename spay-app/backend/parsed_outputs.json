    "strategy_explanation": "This strategy diversifies the sale across all three stocks, even though AAPL has a less severe predicted decline.  This spreads the risk and avoids over-reliance on selling only the worst-performing stocks.  It prioritizes GOOGL due to its higher price and worse long-term outlook while still leveraging META's negative prediction to reach the target cash amount."
